# Huntergram
Huntergram is a free photo sharing site that you host yourself.<br>It's written in pure HTML, raw CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## features
* a strictly finite information feed, curated by you
* a completely static site that you can host on GitHub pages, Glitch, NeoCities, or anywhere else
* a responsive design that scales to fit desktop and mobile web browsers
* "functioning" like, follow, and message buttons
* a ragged leading edge that lets you add new photos in amounts that are not necessarily multiples of three without shifting your existing photos around relative to one another
  * <img src="readme_images/ragged_leading_edge.png" width="50%" height="50%">
  * this "ensured stability" lets you arrange photos spatially
    * the resulting bricolage can be used to share context or recontextualize images based on their proximity to others
    * <img src="readme_images/collage.png" width="50%" height="50%">
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBvvCdhLKdw">lazily-loaded images</a> ensure the site loads quickly regardless of how many pictures you add

## bring your own workflow
* Huntergram's source code just renders a website
  * how you prepare your images, modify the index.html file to reference them, and get your files into your hosting platform is up to you
    * you could write a script to do it for you
    * or you could do it my way

## my workflow
* open a raw image in Gimp
  * if the image is not square, crop it to be square
  * if the image is really big, scale it down to somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 x 1200 pixels
  * export the modified image to the /content directory as a progressive JPEG
  * using Gimp's export preview, use the slider to find an appropriate balance between quality and filesize
      * for 1200x1200-ish images, you can usually go down to around 100kB to 200kB without a serious dip in visual quality
* using my computer's file browser, mock up and select from potential photo arrangements
  * <img src="readme_images/finder.png" width="50%" height="50%">
* open index.html in Vim
  * if a new row needs to be added...
    * copy the conveniently-placed, commented out "row" div
    * paste it wherever i want it to be
  * update the image src attributes to reference the desired photos
* run a python script (not included) to push the updated files to my hosting platform
  * WARNING: photos can contain all kinds of metadata, including GPS coordinates
    * you probably don't wanna upload that to the Internet
    * you can strip image metadata using a program like <a href="https://exiftool.org/">exiftool</a>
      * an example script, strip_metadata.py, is provided, which uses exiftool to strip all metadata from all images in the /huntergram directory

## a simple spell, but quite unbreakable
* huntergram.js includes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">rot13</a> encoder-decoder
  * you can use this to obfuscate your email address enough that bots won't bother finding it, while retaining the ability   to be contacted
